# BinarySearchTree

Building a full-fledged guide to implementing a Binary Search Tree in Java from scratch.

Insertion: O(h)
Search: O(h) 
(where h is the height of the Binary Search Tree)
Deletion: <TODO>
  
Limitations: As of now this data structure only supports unique numbers and will not work for duplicate elements.
